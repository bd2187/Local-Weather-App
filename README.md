FCC Local Weather App

The app tracks a user's location via the "http://ip-api.com/json/" api. Afterwards, it retrieves the current weather data via the "apixu" weather api. The app displays the current weather at the user's location. The user can convert the temperature unit from fahrenheit to celsius and vice versa.
